## Methodology Notes

### Personalization Approach
1. **First name only** - Never use full name or last name
2. **Channel trust signal** - Every message includes channel-specific credibility
3. **Comment parsing** - Extract measurements, materials, urgency, specific issues
4. **Location reference** - When no comment, use city/neighborhood
5. **Buyer stage matching** - CTA intensity matches their readiness

### Quality Standards
- **Length**: All messages 160-320 characters
- **Tone**: Warm, professional, human (not robotic)
- **CTA**: Single, clear next step in every message
- **No generic phrases**: Avoided "landscaping project", "your project"
- **No sender confusion**: Never signed with customer's name

### Competitive Differentiators vs. Baseline
1. **Specific project references** - Not generic "thanks for reaching out"
2. **Channel-aware trust signals** - Different for Angi vs Home Depot vs Yelp
3. **Buyer stage adaptation** - Different CTAs for awareness vs decision
4. **Urgency acknowledgment** - Timeline respect for planning vs ASAP
5. **Technical expertise** - Slope handling, permit awareness, repair vs replace
